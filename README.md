This report summarizes the insight from Amazon sales data, focusing on customer review, rating and product performance. The goal is to identify trends, areas of improvement and product enhancement.

## Methodology
Data was cleaned and analyzed using pivot tables and charts in Excel.
I grouped prices of produtcs into ranges using: =IFS(E2<1000, "$0 - $999", E2<5000, "$1K - $4.9K", E2<10000,"$5K - $9.9K", E2<50000,"$10K-$49.9", E2<100000,"$50K-$99.9K", E2<200000, "$100K - above")

I visualized the trends with:
- Bar charts 
- Pie chart
